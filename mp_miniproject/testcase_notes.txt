file named Testing.txt is used to test program numerics
1.define f with a correct input form
2.test f with a correct input form
3.numint f with a correct input form //might take a long time due to recursive method used
4.mcint f with a correct input form
5.min f with a correct input form

6.define an existing function -> should give a warning 
7.define g with a correct input form
8.test f function using g
