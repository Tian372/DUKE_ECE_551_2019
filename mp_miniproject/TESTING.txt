file named Testing.txt is used to test program numerics
Run ./numirics
And all the test case are in file: Testing.txt
1.define f with a correct input form 
2.test f with a correct input form
3.numint f with a correct input form //might take a long time due to recursive method used
4.mcint f with a correct input form
5.min f with a correct input form
6.define an existing function -> should give a warning 
7.define g with a correct input form
8.test f function using g 
9.empty input
10.test with wrong answer form
11.define abs function using select
12.test abs
13.define a floor and ceil function
14.test floor and ceil  
15.define a function with no variable
16.define a function with unmatched ()
17.define a function with unmatched ()
18.define a function with unmatched ()
19.define a function without (
20.test with wrong answer form
21.test with wrong answer form

Corresponding output:
1.defined f(x y)
2.(f 1 2) = 2 [INCORRECT: expected 0]
3.Numint: integral of f = 3.672
4.Mcint: Integral of f = 3.66868
5.(2, 0)
6.<define> error to attempt to re-define function f
7.defined g(f k)
8.(f (g 3 3) ( f 1 2)) = 12 [INCORRECT: expected -4]
9.input is empty
10.<test> result need to be a number
11.defined abs(x)
12.(abs -2)= 2 [correct]
